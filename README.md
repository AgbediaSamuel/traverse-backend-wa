## FastAPI Service

Minimal FastAPI app with a start script that uses Poetry for dependency management.

### Prerequisites

- Install Poetry (one of):
  - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install poetry`
  - Official installer: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`

### Setup and Run

1) From the project root, install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

2) Ensure you're inside the project directory, then prepare the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry env activate
```

3) Activate the environment by sourcing the command generated by Poetry:

```bash
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

4) Start the server from the project root:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

### Nginx Setup (for ngrok/local development)

If using nginx reverse proxy for local development:

1. Copy the nginx config to nginx's servers directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp infra/nginx-traverse.conf /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/traverse.conf
   # Or on Linux: sudo cp infra/nginx-traverse.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/traverse.conf
   ```

2. Start/restart nginx using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew services start nginx
   # Or to restart if already running:
   brew services restart nginx
   # Or to stop:
   brew services stop nginx
   ```

3. Access the app at `http://localhost:8080` (nginx) instead of individual ports.
